<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>
<br />
<p>Judged by common standards, the <i>Tro&auml;des</i> is far from a perfect play; it
is scarcely even a good play. It is an intense study of one great
situation, with little plot, little construction, little or no relief or
variety. The only movement of the drama is a gradual extinguishing of
all the familiar lights of human life, with, perhaps, at the end, a
suggestion that in the utterness of night, when all fears of a possible
worse thing are passed, there is in some sense peace and even glory. But
the situation itself has at least this dramatic value, that it is
different from what it seems.</p>

<p>The consummation of a great conquest, a thing celebrated in paeans and
thanksgivings, the very height of the day-dreams of unregenerate man&mdash;it
seems to be a great joy, and it is in truth a great misery. It is
conquest seen when the thrill of battle is over, and nothing remains but
to wait and think. We feel in the background the presence of the
conquerors, sinister and disappointed phantoms; of the conquered men,
after long torment, now resting in death. But the living drama for
Euripides lay in the conquered women. It is from them that he has named
his play and built up his scheme of parts: four figures clearly lit and
heroic, the others in varying grades of characterisation, nameless and
barely articulate, mere half-heard voices of an eternal sorrow.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<p>Indeed, the most usual condemnation of the play is not that it is dull,
but that it is too harrowing; that scene after scene passes beyond the
due limits of tragic art. There are points to be pleaded against this
criticism. The very beauty of the most fearful scenes, in spite of their
fearfulness, is one; the quick comfort of the lyrics is another, falling
like a spell of peace when the strain is too hard to bear (cf. p. 89).
But the main defence is that, like many of the greatest works of art,
the <i>Tro&auml;des</i> is something more than art. It is also a prophecy, a
bearing of witness. And the prophet, bound to deliver his message, walks
outside the regular ways of the artist.</p>

<p>For some time before the <i>Tro&auml;des</i> was produced, Athens, now entirely in
the hands of the War Party, had been engaged in an enterprise which,
though on military grounds defensible, was bitterly resented by the more
humane minority, and has been selected by Thucydides as the great
crucial crime of the war. She had succeeded in compelling the neutral
Dorian island of M&ecirc;los to take up arms against her, and after a long
siege had conquered the quiet and immemorially ancient town, massacred
the men and sold the women and children into slavery. M&ecirc;los fell in the
autumn of 416 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The <i>Tro&auml;des</i> was produced in the following spring.
And while the gods of the prologue were prophesying destruction at sea
for the sackers of Troy, the fleet of the sackers of M&ecirc;los, flushed with
conquest and marked by a slight but unforgettable taint of sacrilege,
was actually preparing to set sail for its fatal enterprise against
Sicily.</p>

<p>Not, of course, that we have in the <i>Tro&auml;des</i> a case of political
allusion. Far from it. Euripides does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
mean M&ecirc;los when he says Troy,
nor mean Alcibiades' fleet when he speaks of Agamemnon's. But he writes
under the influence of a year which to him, as to Thucydides, had been
filled full of indignant pity and of dire foreboding. This tragedy is
perhaps, in European literature, the first great expression of the
spirit of pity for mankind exalted into a moving principle; a principle
which has made the most precious, and possibly the most destructive,
elements of innumerable rebellions, revolutions, and martyrdoms, and of
at least two great religions.</p>

<p>Pity is a rebel passion. Its hand is against the strong, against the
organised force of society, against conventional sanctions and accepted
Gods. It is the Kingdom of Heaven within us fighting against the brute
powers of the world; and it is apt to have those qualities of unreason,
of contempt for the counting of costs and the balancing of sacrifices,
of recklessness, and even, in the last resort, of ruthlessness, which so
often mark the paths of heavenly things and the doings of the children
of light. It brings not peace, but a sword.</p>

<p>So it was with Euripides. The <i>Tro&auml;des</i> itself has indeed almost no
fierceness and singularly little thought of revenge. It is only the
crying of one of the great wrongs of the world wrought into music, as it
were, and made beautiful by "the most tragic of the poets." But its
author lived ever after in a deepening atmosphere of strife and even of
hatred, down to the day when, "because almost all in Athens rejoiced at
his suffering," he took his way to the remote valleys of Macedon to
write the <i>Bacchae</i> and to die.</p>

At the back are the walls of Troy, partially ruined. In front of
them, to right and left, are some huts, containing those of the
Captive Women who have been specially set apart for the chief Greek
leaders. At one side some dead bodies of armed men are visible. In
front a tall woman with white hair is lying on the ground asleep.</i></p>

<pre>
Up from Aegean caverns, pool by pool
Of blue salt sea, where feet most beautiful
Of Nere&iuml;d maidens weave beneath the foam
Their long sea-dances, I, their lord, am come,
Poseidon of the Sea. 'Twas I whose power,
With great Apollo, builded tower by tower
These walls of Troy; and still my care doth stand
True to the ancient People of my hand;
Which now as smoke is perished, in the shock
Of Argive spears. Down from Parnassus' rock
The Greek Epeios came, of Phocian seed,
And wrought by Pallas' mysteries a Steed
Marvellous, big with arms; and through my wall
It passed, a death-fraught image magical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
    The groves are empty and the sanctuaries
Run red with blood. Unburied Priam lies
By his own hearth, on God's high altar-stair,
And Phrygian gold goes forth and raiment rare
To the Argive ships; and weary soldiers roam
Waiting the wind that blows at last for home,
For wives and children, left long years away,
Beyond the seed's tenth fullness and decay,
To work this land's undoing.
                                            And for me,
Since Argive Hera conquereth, and she
Who wrought with Hera to the Phrygians' woe,
Pallas, behold, I bow mine head and go
Forth from great Ilion and mine altars old.
When a still city lieth in the hold
Of Desolation, all God's spirit there
Is sick and turns from worship.&mdash;Hearken where
The ancient River waileth with a voice
Of many women, portioned by the choice
Of war amid new lords, as the lots leap
For Thessaly, or Argos, or the steep
Of Theseus' Rock. And others yet there are,
High women, chosen from the waste of war
For the great kings, behind these portals hid;
And with them that Laconian Tyndarid,
Helen, like them a prisoner and a prize.
    And this unhappy one&mdash;would any eyes
Gaze now on Hecuba? Here at the Gates
She lies 'mid many tears for many fates
Of wrong. One child beside Achilles' grave
In secret slain, Polyxena the brave,
Lies bleeding. Priam and his sons are gone;
And, lo, Cassandra, she the Chosen One,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Whom Lord Apollo spared to walk her way
A swift and virgin spirit, on this day
Lust hath her, and she goeth garlanded
A bride of wrath to Agamemnon's bed.

O Mother, fill mine hair with happy flowers,
And speed me forth. Yea, if my spirit cowers,
Drive me with wrath! So liveth Loxias,
A bloodier bride than ever Helen was
Go I to Agamemnon, Lord most high
Of Hellas! . . . I shall kill him, mother; I
Shall kill him, and lay waste his house with fire
As he laid ours. My brethren and my sire
Shall win again . . .
        (<i>Checking herself</i>) But part I must let be,
And speak not. Not the axe that craveth me,
And more than me; not the dark wanderings
Of mother-murder that my bridal brings,
And all the House of Atreus down, down, down . .

    Nay, I will show thee. Even now this town
Is happier than the Greeks. I know the power
Of God is on me: but this little hour,
Wilt thou but listen, I will hold him back!
    One love, one woman's beauty, o'er the track
Of hunted Helen, made their myriads fall.
And this their King so wise, who ruleth all,
What wrought he? Cast out Love that Hate might feed:
Gave to his brother his own child, his seed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Of gladness, that a woman fled, and fain
To fly for ever, should be turned again!
    So the days waned, and armies on the shore
Of Simois stood and strove and died. Wherefore?
No man had moved their landmarks; none had shook
Their wall&egrave;d towns.&mdash;And they whom Ares took,
Had never seen their children: no wife came
With gentle arms to shroud the limbs of them
For burial, in a strange and angry earth
Laid dead. And there at home, the same long dearth:
Women that lonely died, and aged men
Waiting for sons that ne'er should turn again,
Nor know their graves, nor pour drink-offerings,
To still the unslak&egrave;d dust. These be the things
The conquering Greek hath won!
                                                But we&mdash;what pride,
What praise of men were sweeter?&mdash;fighting died
To save our people. And when war was red
Around us, friends upbore the gentle dead
Home, and dear women's hands about them wound
White shrouds, and here they sleep in the old ground
Belov&egrave;d. And the rest long days fought on,
Dwelling with wives and children, not alone
And joyless, like these Greeks.
                                                 And Hector's woe,
What is it? He is gone, and all men know
His glory, and how true a heart he bore.
It is the gift the Greek hath brought! Of yore
Men saw him not, nor knew him. Yea, and even
Paris hath loved withal a child of heaven:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Else had his love but been as others are.
    Would ye be wise, ye Cities, fly from war!
Yet if war come, there is a crown in death
For her that striveth well and perisheth
Unstained: to die in evil were the stain!
Therefore, O Mother, pity not thy slain,
Nor Troy, nor me, the bride. Thy direst foe
And mine by this my wooing is brought low.

Murdered, and round him all his citadel
Sacked. And my daughters, virgins of the fold,

O Mother, having ears, hear thou this word
Fear-conquering, till thy heart as mine be stirred
With joy. To die is only not to be;
And better to be dead than grievously
Living. They have no pain, they ponder not
Their own wrong. But the living that is brought
From joy to heaviness, his soul doth roam,
As in a desert, lost, from its old home.
Thy daughter lieth now as one unborn,
Dead, and naught knowing of the lust and scorn
That slew her. And I . . . long since I drew my bow
Straight at the heart of good fame; and I know
My shaft hit; and for that am I the more
Fallen from peace. All that men praise us for,
I loved for Hector's sake, and sought to win.
I knew that alway, be there hurt therein
Or utter innocence, to roam abroad
Hath ill report for women; so I trod
Down the desire thereof, and walked my way
In mine own garden. And light words and gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Parley of women never passed my door.
The thoughts of mine own heart . . . I craved no more . . .
Spoke with me, and I was happy. Constantly
I brought fair silence and a tranquil eye
For Hector's greeting, and watched well the way
Of living, where to guide and where obey.
    And, lo! some rumour of this peace, being gone
Forth to the Greek, hath cursed me. Achilles' son,
So soon as I was taken, for his thrall
Chose me. I shall do service in the hall
Of them that slew . . . How? Shall I thrust aside
Hector's belov&egrave;d face, and open wide
My heart to this new lord? Oh, I should stand
A traitor to the dead! And if my hand
And flesh shrink from him . . . lo, wrath and despite
O'er all the house, and I a slave!

A woman in a man's arms. . . . O shame, shame!
What woman's lips can so forswear her dead,
And give strange kisses in another's bed?
Why, not a dumb beast, not a colt will run
In the yoke untroubled, when her mate is gone&mdash;
A thing not in God's image, dull, unmoved
Of reason. O my Hector! best beloved,
That, being mine, wast all in all to me,
My prince, my wise one, O my majesty
Of valiance! No man's touch had ever come
Near me, when thou from out my father's home
Didst lead me and make me thine. . . . And thou art dead,
And I war-flung to slavery and the bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Of shame in Hellas, over bitter seas!
    What knoweth she of evils like to these,
That dead Polyxena, thou weepest for?
There liveth not in my life any more
The hope that others have. Nor will I tell
The lie to mine own heart, that aught is well
Or shall be well. . . . Yet, O, to dream were sweet!

Lo, yonder ships: I ne'er set foot on one,
But tales and pictures tell, when over them
Breaketh a storm not all too strong to stem,
Each man strives hard, the tiller gripped, the mast
Manned, the hull baled, to face it: till at last
Too strong breaks the o'erwhelming sea: lo, then
They cease, and yield them up as broken men
To fate and the wild waters. Even so
I in my many sorrows bear me low,
Nor curse, nor strive that other things may be.
The great wave rolled from God hath conquered me.
    But, O, let Hector and the fates that fell
On Hector, sleep. Weep for him ne'er so well,
Thy weeping shall not wake him. Honour thou

                The gentle, the earth-loving,
        That shineth on battlements broken
            In Troy, and a people forlorn!
        And, lo, in her bowers Tith&ocirc;nus,
            Our brother, yet sleeps as of old:
        O, she too hath loved us and known us,
            And the Steeds of her star, flashing gold,
        Stooped hither and bore him above us;
            Then blessed we the Gods in our joy.
        But all that made them to love us
                Hath perished from Troy.

My pleasure; perchance kill her, or not kill,
But lead her home.&mdash;Methinks I have foregone
The slaying of Helen here in Ilion . . .
Over the long seas I will bear her back,
And there, there, cast her out to whatso wrack
Of angry death they may devise, who know
Their dearest dead for her in Ilion.&mdash;Ho!

<pre>    <i>She</i> cometh first, who bare the seed and well
Of springing sorrow, when to life she brought
Paris: and that old King, who quench&egrave;d not
Quick in the spark, ere yet he woke to slay,
The firebrand's image.&mdash;But enough: a day
Came, and this Paris judged beneath the trees
Three Crowns of Life, three diverse Goddesses.
The gift of Pallas was of War, to lead
His East in conquering battles, and make bleed
The hearths of Hellas. Hera held a Throne&mdash;
If majesties he craved&mdash;to reign alone
From Phrygia to the last realm of the West.
And Cypris, if he deemed her loveliest,
Beyond all heaven, made dreams about my face
And for her grace gave me. And, lo! her grace
Was judged the fairest, and she stood above
Those twain.&mdash;Thus was I loved, and thus my love
Hath holpen Hellas. No fierce Eastern crown
Is o'er your lands, no spear hath cast them down.
O, it was well for Hellas! But for me
Most ill; caught up and sold across the sea
For this my beauty; yea, dishonour&egrave;d
For that which else had been about my head
A crown of honour. . . . Ah, I see thy thought;
The first plain deed, 'tis that I answer not,
How in the dark out of thy house I fled . . .
There came the Seed of Fire, this woman's seed;
Came&mdash;O, a Goddess great walked with him then&mdash;
This Alexander, Breaker-down-of-Men,
This Paris, Strength-is-with-him; whom thou, whom&mdash;
O false and light of heart&mdash;thou in thy room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Didst leave, and spreadest sail for Cretan seas,
Far, far from me! . . . And yet, how strange it is!
I ask not thee; I ask my own sad thought,
What was there in my heart, that I forgot
My home and land and all I loved, to fly
With a strange man? Surely it was not I,
But Cypris, there! Lay thou thy rod on her,
And be more high than Zeus and bitterer,
Who o'er all other spirits hath his throne,
But knows her chain must bind him. My wrong done
Hath its own pardon. . . .
                                    One word yet thou hast,
Methinks, of righteous seeming. When at last
The earth for Paris oped and all was o'er,
And her strange magic bound my feet no more,
Why kept I still his house, why fled not I
To the Argive ships? . . . Ah, how I strove to fly!
The old Gate-Warden could have told thee all,
My husband, and the watchers from the wall;
It was not once they took me, with the rope
Tied, and this body swung in the air, to grope
Its way toward <i>thee</i>, from that dim battlement.
    Ah, husband still, how shall thy hand be bent
To slay me? Nay, if Right be come at last,
What shalt thou bring but comfort for pains past,
And harbour for a woman storm-driven:
A woman borne away by violent men:
And this one birthright of my beauty, this
That might have been my glory, lo, it is
A stamp that God hath burned, of slavery!
    Alas! and if thou cravest still to be
As one set above gods, inviolate,
'Tis but a fruitless longing holds thee yet.

Meseems her goddesses first cry mine aid
Against these lying lips! . . . Not Hera, nay,
Nor virgin Pallas deem I such low clay,
To barter their own folk, Argos and brave
Athens, to be trod down, the Phrygian's slave,
All for vain glory and a shepherd's prize
On Ida! Wherefore should great Hera's eyes
So hunger to be fair? <i>She</i> doth not use
To seek for other loves, being wed with Zeus.
And maiden Pallas . . . did some strange god's face
Beguile her, that she craved for loveliness,
Who chose from God one virgin gift above
All gifts, and fle&euml;th from the lips of love?
    Ah, deck not out thine own heart's evil springs
By making spirits of heaven as brutish things
And cruel. The wise may hear thee, and guess all!
    And Cypris must take ship&mdash;fantastical!
Sail with my son and enter at the gate
To seek thee! Had she willed it, she had sate
At peace in heaven, and wafted thee, and all
Amyclae with thee, under Ilion's wall.
    My son was passing beautiful, beyond
His peers; and thine own heart, that saw and conned
His face, became a spirit enchanting thee.
For all wild things that in mortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Have being, are Aphrodit&ecirc;; and the name
She bears in heaven is born and writ of them.
    Thou sawest him in gold and orient vest
Shining, and lo, a fire about thy breast
Leapt! Thou hadst fed upon such little things,
Pacing thy ways in Argos. But now wings
Were come! Once free from Sparta, and there rolled
The Ilian glory, like broad streams of gold,
To steep thine arms and splash the towers! How small,
How cold that day was Menelaus' hall!
    Enough of that. It was by force my son
Took thee, thou sayst, and striving. . . . Yet not one
In Sparta knew! No cry, no sudden prayer
Rang from thy rooms that night. . . . Castor was there
To hear thee, and his brother: both true men,
Not yet among the stars! And after, when
Thou camest here to Troy, and in thy track
Argos and all its anguish and the rack
Of war&mdash;Ah God!&mdash;perchance men told thee 'Now
The Greek prevails in battle': then wouldst thou
Praise Menelaus, that my son might smart,
Striving with that old image in a heart
Uncertain still. Then Troy had victories:
And this Greek was as naught! Alway thine eyes
Watched Fortune's eyes, to follow hot where she
Led first. Thou wouldst not follow Honesty.
    Thy secret ropes, thy body swung to fall
Far, like a desperate prisoner, from the wall!
Who found thee so? When wast thou taken? Nay,
Hadst thou no surer rope, no sudden way
Of the sword, that any woman honest-souled
Had sought long since, loving her lord of old?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
    Often and often did I charge thee; 'Go,
My daughter; go thy ways. My sons will know
New loves. I will give aid, and steal thee past
The Argive watch. O give us peace at last,
Us and our foes!' But out thy spirit cried
As at a bitter word. Thou hadst thy pride
In Alexander's house, and O, 'twas sweet
To hold proud Easterns bowing at thy feet.
They were great things to thee! . . . And comest thou now
Forth, and hast decked thy bosom and thy brow,
And breathest with thy lord the same blue air,
Thou evil heart? Low, low, with ravaged hair,
Rent raiment, and flesh shuddering, and within&mdash;
O shame at last, not glory for thy sin;
So face him if thou canst! . . . Lo, I have done.
Be true, O King; let Hellas bear her crown
Of Justice. Slay this woman, and upraise
The law for evermore: she that betrays
Her husband's bed, let her be judged and die.

For burial of this babe, thine Hector's son,
That now from Ilion's tower is fallen and dead.
And, lo! this great bronze-fronted shield, the dread
Of many a Greek, that Hector held in fray,
O never in God's name&mdash;so did she pray&mdash;
Be this borne forth to hang in P&ecirc;leus' hall
Or that dark bridal chamber, that the wall
May hurt her eyes; but here, in Troy o'erthrown,
Instead of cedar wood and vaulted stone,
Be this her child's last house. . . . And in thine hands
She bade me lay him, to be swathed in bands
Of death and garments, such as rest to thee
In these thy fallen fortunes; seeing that she
Hath gone her ways, and, for her master's haste,
May no more fold the babe unto his rest.
    Howbeit, so soon as he is garlanded
And robed, we will heap earth above his head
And lift our sails. . . . See all be swiftly done,
As thou art bidden. I have saved thee one
Labour. For as I passed Scamander's stream
Hard by, I let the waters run on him,
And cleansed his wounds.&mdash;See, I will go forth now
And break the hard earth for his grave: so thou
And I will haste together, to set free
Our oars at last to beat the homeward sea!

Set the great orb of Hector's shield to lie
Here on the ground. 'Tis bitter that mine eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Should see it. . . . O ye Argives, was your spear
Keen, and your hearts so low and cold, to fear
This babe? 'Twas a strange murder for brave men!
For fear this babe some day might raise again
His fallen land! Had ye so little pride?
While Hector fought, and thousands at his side,
Ye smote us, and we perished; and now, now,
When all are dead and Ilion lieth low,
Ye dread this innocent! I deem it not
Wisdom, that rage of fear that hath no thought. . . .
    Ah, what a death hath found thee, little one!
Hadst thou but fallen fighting, hadst thou known
Strong youth and love and all the majesty
Of godlike kings, then had we spoken of thee
As of one bless&egrave;d . . . could in any wise
These days know blessedness. But now thine eyes
Have seen, thy lips have tasted, but thy soul
No knowledge had nor usage of the whole
Rich life that lapt thee round. . . . Poor little child!
Was it our ancient wall, the circuit piled
By loving Gods, so savagely hath rent
Thy curls, these little flowers innocent
That were thy mother's garden, where she laid
Her kisses; here, just where the bone-edge frayed
Grins white above&mdash;Ah heaven, I will not see!
    Ye tender arms, the same dear mould have ye
As his; how from the shoulder loose ye drop
And weak! And dear proud lips, so full of hope
And closed for ever! What false words ye said
At daybreak, when he crept into my bed,
Called me kind names, and promised: 'Grandmother,
When thou art dead, I will cut close my hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
And lead out all the captains to ride by
Thy tomb.' Why didst thou cheat me so? 'Tis I,
Old, homeless, childless, that for thee must shed
Cold tears, so young, so miserably dead.
    Dear God, the pattering welcomes of thy feet,
The nursing in my lap; and O, the sweet
Falling asleep together! All is gone.
How should a poet carve the funeral stone
To tell thy story true? 'There lieth here
A babe whom the Greeks feared, and in their fear
Slew him.' Aye, Greece will bless the tale it tells!
    Child, they have left thee beggared of all else
In Hector's house; but one thing shalt thou keep,
This war-shield bronzen-barred, wherein to sleep.
Alas, thou guardian true of Hector's fair
Left arm, how art thou masterless! And there
I see his handgrip printed on thy hold;
And deep stains of the precious sweat, that rolled
In battle from the brows and beard of him,
Drop after drop, are writ about thy rim.
    Go, bring them&mdash;such poor garments hazardous
As these days leave. God hath not granted us
Wherewith to make much pride. But all I can,
I give thee, Child of Troy.&mdash;O vain is man,
Who glorieth in his joy and hath no fears:
While to and fro the chances of the years
Dance like an idiot in the wind! And none
By any strength hath his own fortune won.

<h2>NOTES ON THE TROJAN WOMEN</h2>

<br />
<p>P. 11, l. 5, Poseidon.]&mdash;In the <i>Iliad</i> Poseidon is the enemy of Troy,
here the friend. This sort of confusion comes from the fact that the
Trojans and their Greek enemies were largely of the same blood, with the
same tribal gods. To the Trojans, Athena the War-Goddess was, of course,
<i>their</i> War-Goddess, the protectress of their citadel. Poseidon, god of
the sea and its merchandise, and Apollo (possibly a local shepherd
god?), were their natural friends and had actually built their city wall
for love of the good old king, Laomedon. Zeus, the great father, had
Mount Ida for his holy hill and Troy for his peculiar city. (Cf. on p.
63.)</p>

<p>To suit the Greek point of view all this had to be changed or explained
away. In the <i>Iliad</i> generally Athena is the proper War-Goddess of the
Greeks. Poseidon had indeed built the wall for Laomedon, but Laomedon
had cheated him of his reward&mdash;as afterwards he cheated Heracles, and
the Argonauts and everybody else! So Poseidon hated Troy. Troy is
chiefly defended by the barbarian Ares, the oriental Aphrodite, by its
own rivers Scamander and Simo&iuml;s and suchlike inferior or unprincipled
gods.</p>

<p>Yet traces of the other tradition remain. Homer knows that Athena is
specially worshipped in Troy. He knows that Apollo, who had built the
wall with Poseidon, and had the same experience of Laomedon, still loves
the Trojans. Zeus himself, though eventually in obedience to destiny he
permits the fall of the city, nevertheless has a great tenderness
towards it.

<p>P. 12, l. 25, I go forth from great Ilion, &amp;c.]&mdash;The correct ancient
doctrine. When your gods forsook you, there was no more hope.
Conversely, when your state became desperate, evidently your gods were
forsaking you. From another point of view, also, when the city was
desolate and unable to worship its gods, the gods of that city were no
more.</p>

<p>P. 12, l. 34, Laconian Tyndarid.]&mdash;Helen was the child of Zeus and Leda,
and sister of Castor and Polydeuces; but her human father was Tyndareus,
an old Spartan king. She is treated as "a prisoner and a prize," <i>i.e.</i>,
as a captured enemy, not as a Greek princess delivered from the Trojans.</p>

<p>P. 12, l. 40, In secret slain.]&mdash;Because the Greeks were ashamed of the
bloody deed. See below, p. 42, and the scene on this subject in the
<i>Hecuba</i>.</p>

<p>P. 12, l. 42, Cassandra.]&mdash;In the <i>Agamemnon</i> the story is more clearly
told, that Cassandra was loved by Apollo and endowed by him with the
power of prophecy; then in some way she rejected or betrayed him, and he
set upon her the curse that though seeing the truth she should never be
believed. The figure of Cassandra in this play is not inconsistent with
that version, but it makes a different impression. She is here a
dedicated virgin, and her mystic love for Apollo does not seem to have
suffered any breach.</p>

<p>P. 13, l. 47, Pallas.]&mdash;(See above.) The historical explanation of the
Trojan Pallas and the Greek Pallas is simple enough, but as soon as the
two are mythologically personified and made one, there emerges just such
a bitter and ruthless goddess as Euripides, in his revolt against the
current mythology, loved to depict. But it is not only the mythology
that he is attacking. He seems really to feel that if there are
conscious gods ruling the world, they are cruel or "inhuman" beings.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>

<p>P. 15, l. 70.]&mdash;Ajax the Less, son of O&iuml;leus, either ravished or
attempted to ravish Cassandra (the story occurs in both forms) while she
was clinging to the Palladium or image of Pallas. It is one of the great
typical sins of the Sack of Troy, often depicted on vases.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 123, Faces of ships.]&mdash;Homeric ships had prows shaped and
painted to look like birds' or beasts' heads. A ship was always a
wonderfully live and vivid thing to the Greek poets. (Cf. p. 64.)</p>

<p>P. 18, l. 132, Castor.]&mdash;Helen's brother: the Eur&ocirc;tas, the river of her
home, Sparta.</p>

<p>P. 18, l. 135, Fifty seeds.]&mdash;Priam had fifty children, nineteen of them
children of Hecuba (<i>Il.</i> vi. 451, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>P. 22, l. 205, Pirene.]&mdash;The celebrated spring on the hill of Corinth.
Drawing water was a typical employment of slaves.</p>

<p>P. 22, l. 219 ff., Theseus' land, &amp;c.]&mdash;Theseus' land is Attica. The
poet, in the midst of his bitterness over the present conduct of his
city, clings the more to its old fame for humanity. The "land high-born"
where the Pen&ecirc;&uuml;s flows round the base of Mount Olympus in northern
Thessaly is one of the haunts of Euripides' dreams in many plays. Cf.
<i>Bacchae</i>, 410 (p. 97 in my translation). Mount Aetna fronts the
"Tyrians' citadel," <i>i.e.</i>, Carthage, built by the Phoenicians. The
"sister land" is the district of Sybaris in South Italy, where the river
Crathis has, or had, a red-gold colour, which makes golden the hair of
men and the fleeces of sheep; and the water never lost its freshness.</p>

<p>P. 23, l. 235.]&mdash;Talthybius is a loyal soldier with every wish to be
kind. But he is naturally in good spirits over the satisfactory end of
the war, and his tact is not sufficient to enable him to understand the
Trojan Women's feelings. Yet in the end, since he has to see and do the
cruelties which his Chiefs only order from a distance, the real nature
of his work forces itself upon him, and he feels and speaks at times
almost like a Trojan. It is worth noticing how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the Trojan Women generally avoid addressing him. (Cf. pp. 48, 67, 74.)</p>

<p>P. 24, l. 256, The haunted keys (literally, "with God through them,
penetrating them").]&mdash;Cassandra was his Key-bearer, holding the door of
his Holy Place. (Cf. <i>Hip.</i> 540, p. 30.)</p>

<p>P. 25, l. 270, She hath a toil, &amp;c.]&mdash;There is something true and
pathetic about this curious blindness which prevents Hecuba from
understanding "so plain a riddle." (Cf. below, p. 42.) She takes the
watching of a Tomb to be some strange Greek custom, and does not seek to
have it explained further.</p>

<p>P. 26, l. 277, Odysseus.]&mdash;In Euripides generally Odysseus is the type
of the successful unscrupulous man, as soldier and politician&mdash;the
incarnation of what the poet most hated. In Homer of course he is
totally different.</p>

<p>P. 27, l. 301, Burn themselves and die.]&mdash;Women under these
circumstances did commit suicide in Euripides' day, as they have ever
since. It is rather curious that none of the characters of the play, not
even Andromache, kills herself. The explanation must be that no such
suicide was recorded in the tradition (though cf. below, on p. 33); a
significant fact, suggesting that in the Homeric age, when this kind of
treatment of women captives was regular, the victims did not suffer
quite so terribly under it.</p>

<p>P. 28, l. 310, Hymen.]&mdash;She addresses the Torch. The shadowy
Marriage-god "Hymen" was a torch and a cry as much as anything more
personal. As a torch he is the sign both of marriage and of death, of
sunrise and of the consuming fire. The full Moon was specially connected
with marriage ceremonies.</p>

<p>P. 30, l. 356, Loxias.]&mdash;The name of Apollo as an Oracular God.</p>

<p>Pp. 30-34, ll. 360-460, Cassandra's visions.]&mdash;The allusions are to the
various sufferings of Odysseus, as narrated in the <i>Odyssey</i>, and to the
tragedies of the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of Atreus, as told for instance in Aeschylus'
<i>Oresteia</i>. Agamemnon together with Cassandra, and in part because he
brought Cassandra, was murdered&mdash;felled with an axe&mdash;on his return home
by his wife Clytaemnestra and her lover Aegisthus. Their bodies were
cast into a pit among the rocks. In vengeance for this, Orestes,
Agamemnon's son, committed "mother-murder," and in consequence was
driven by the Erinyes (Furies) of his mother into madness and exile.</p>

<p>P. 30, l. 370, This their king so wise.]&mdash;Agamemnon made the war for the
sake of his brother Menelaus, and slew his daughter, Iphigenia, as a
sacrifice at Aulis, to enable the ships to sail for Troy.</p>

<p>P. 31, ll. 394, 398, Hector and Paris.]&mdash;The point about Hector is
clear, but as to Paris, the feeling that, after all, it was a glory that
he and the half-divine Helen loved each other, is scarcely to be found
anywhere else in Greek literature. (Cf., however, Isocrates' "Praise of
Helen.") Paris and Helen were never idealised like Launcelot and
Guinevere, or Tristram and Iseult.</p>

<p>P. 32, l. 423, A wise queen.]&mdash;Penelope, the faithful wife of Odysseus.</p>

<p>P. 33, l. 425, O Heralds, yea, Voices of Death.]&mdash;There is a play on the
word for "heralds" in the Greek here, which I have evaded by a
paraphrase. (&#922;&#8053;&#961;-&#965;&#954;&#949;&#962; [Greek: K&ecirc;r-ukes] as though from &#922;&#8052;&#961; [Greek: K&ecirc;r]
the death-spirit, "the one thing abhorred of all mortal men.")</p>

<p>P. 33, l. 430, That in this place she dies.]&mdash;The death of Hecuba is
connected with a certain heap of stones on the shore of the Hellespont,
called <i>Kunos-s&ecirc;ma</i>, or "Dog's Tomb." According to one tradition (Eur.
<i>Hec.</i> 1259 ff.) she threw herself off the ship into the sea; according
to another she was stoned by the Greeks for her curses upon the fleet;
but in both she is changed after death into a sort of Hell-hound. M.
Victor B&eacute;rard suggests that the dog first comes into the story owing to
the accidental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
resemblance of the (hypothetical) Semitic word
<i>S'qoulah</i>, "Stone" or "Stoning," and the Greek <i>Skulax</i>, dog. The
Homeric Scylla (<i>Skulla</i>) was also both a Stone and a Dog (<i>Ph&eacute;niciens
et Odyss&eacute;e</i>, i. 213). Of course in the present passage there is no
direct reference to these wild sailor-stories.</p>

<p>P. 34, l. 456, The wind comes quick.]&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> The storm of the Prologue.
Three Powers: the three Erinyes.</p>

<p>P. 36, l. 511 ff., Chorus.]&mdash;The Wooden Horse is always difficult to
understand, and seems to have an obscuring effect on the language of
poets who treat of it. I cannot help suspecting that the story arises
from a real historical incident misunderstood. Troy, we are told, was
still holding out after ten years and could not be taken, until at last
by the divine suggestions of Athena, a certain Epeios devised a "Wooden
Horse."</p>

<p>What was the "device"? According to the <i>Odyssey</i> and most Greek poets,
it was a gigantic wooden figure of a horse. A party of heroes, led by
Odysseus, got inside it and waited. The Greeks made a show of giving up
the siege and sailed away, but only as far as Tenedos. The Trojans came
out and found the horse, and after wondering greatly what it was meant
for and what to do with it, made a breach in their walls and dragged it
into the Citadel as a thank-offering to Pallas. In the night the Greeks
returned; the heroes in the horse came out and opened the gates, and
Troy was captured.</p>

<p>It seems possible that the "device" really was the building of a wooden
siege-tower, as high as the walls, with a projecting and revolving neck.
Such engines were (1) capable of being used at the time in Asia, as a
rare and extraordinary device, because they exist on early Assyrian
monuments; (2) certain to be misunderstood in Greek legendary tradition,
because they were not used in Greek warfare till many centuries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
later. (First, perhaps, at the sieges of Perinthus and Byzantium by Philip of
Macedon, 340 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in the great picture by Polygn&ocirc;tus in the Lesch&ecirc;
at Delphi "above the wall of Troy appears the head alone of the Wooden
Horse" (<i>Paus.</i> x. 26). Aeschylus also (<i>Ag.</i> 816) has some obscure
phrases pointing in the same direction: "A horse's brood, a
shield-bearing people, launched with a leap about the Pleiads' setting,
sprang clear above the wall," &amp;c. Euripides here treats the horse
metaphorically as a sort of war-horse trampling Troy.</p>

<p>P. 37, l. 536, Her that spareth not, Heaven's yokeless rider.]&mdash;Athena
like a northern Valkyrie, as often in the <i>Iliad</i>. If one tries to
imagine what Athena, the War-Goddess worshipped by the Athenian mob, was
like&mdash;what a mixture of bad national passions, of superstition and
statecraft, of slip-shod unimaginative idealisation&mdash;one may partly
understand why Euripides made her so evil. Allegorists and high-minded
philosophers might make Athena entirely noble by concentrating their
minds on the beautiful elements in the tradition, and forgetting or
explaining away all that was savage; he was determined to pin her down
to the worst facts recorded of her, and let people worship such a being
if they liked!</p>

<p>P. 38, l. 554, To Artemis.]&mdash;Maidens at the shrine of Artemis are a
fixed datum in the tradition. (Cf. <i>Hec.</i> 935 ff.)</p>

<p>P. 39 ff., l. 576 ff., Andromache and Hecuba.]&mdash;This very beautiful
scene is perhaps marred to most modern readers by an element which is
merely a part of the convention of ancient mourning. Each of the
mourners cries: "There is no affliction like mine!" and then proceeds to
argue, as it were, against the other's counter claim. One can only say
that it was, after all, what they expected of each other; and I believe
the same convention exists in most places where keening or wailing is an
actual practice.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

<p>P. 41, l. 604, Even as the sound of a song.]&mdash;I have filled in some
words which seem to be missing in the Greek here.</p>

<p>Pp. 41-50, Andromache.]&mdash;This character is wonderfully studied. She
seems to me to be a woman who has not yet shown much character or
perhaps had very intense experience, but is only waiting for
sufficiently great trials to become a heroine and a saint. There is
still a marked element of conventionality in her description of her life
with Hector; but one feels, as she speaks, that she is already past it.
Her character is built up of "<i>Sophrosyne</i>," of self-restraint and the
love of goodness&mdash;qualities which often seem second-rate or even
tiresome until they have a sufficiently great field in which to act.
Very characteristic is her resolution to make the best, and not the
worst, of her life in Pyrrhus' house, with all its horror of suffering
and apparent degradation. So is the self-conquest by which she
deliberately refrains from cursing her child's murderers, for the sake
of the last poor remnant of good she can still do to him, in getting him
buried. The nobility of such a character depends largely, of course, on
the intensity of the feelings conquered.</p>

<p>It is worth noting, in this connection, that Euripides is contradicting
a wide-spread tradition (Robert, <i>Bild und Lied</i>, pp. 63 ff.).
Andromache, in the pictures of the Sack of Troy, is represented with a
great pestle or some such instrument fighting with the Soldiers to
rescue Astyanax (&#7944;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;-&#956;&#8049;&#967;&#951; [Greek: Andro-mach&ecirc;]="Man-fighting").</p>

<p>Observe, too, what a climax of drama is reached by means of the very
fact that Andromache, to the utmost of her power, tries to do nothing
"dramatic," but only what will be best. Her character in Euripides'
play, <i>Andromache</i>, is, on the whole, similar to this, but less
developed.</p>

<p>P. 51, l. 799 ff., In Salamis, filled with the foaming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> &amp;c.]&mdash;A
striking instance of the artistic value of the Greek chorus in relieving
an intolerable strain. The relief provided is something much higher than
what we ordinarily call "relief"; it is a stream of pure poetry and
music in key with the sadness of the surrounding scene, yet, in a way,
happy just because it is beautiful. (Cf. note on <i>Hippolytus</i>, l. 732.)</p>

<p>The argument of the rather difficult lyric is: "This is not the first
time Troy has been taken. Long ago Heracles made war against the old
king Laomedon, because he had not given him the immortal steeds that he
promised. And Telamon joined him; Telamon who might have been happy in
his island of Salamis, among the bees and the pleasant waters, looking
over the strait to the olive-laden hills of Athens, the beloved City!
And they took ship and slew Laomedon. Yea, twice Zeus has destroyed
Ilion!</p>

<p>(Second part.) Is it all in vain that our Trojan princes have been loved
by the Gods? Ganym&ecirc;d&ecirc;s pours the nectar of Zeus in his banquets, his
face never troubled, though his motherland is burned with fire! And, to
say nothing of Zeus, how can the Goddess of Morning rise and shine upon
us uncaring? She loved Tith&ocirc;nus, son of Laomedon, and bore him up from
us in a chariot to be her husband in the skies. But all that once made
them love us is gone!"</p>

<p>P. 52, l. 833, Pools of thy bathing.]&mdash;It is probable that Ganym&ecirc;d&ecirc;s was
himself originally a pool or a spring on Ida, now a pourer of nectar in
heaven.</p>

<p>Pp. 54-63, Menelaus and Helen.]&mdash;The meeting of Menelaus and Helen after
the taking of Troy was naturally one of the great moments in the heroic
legend. The versions, roughly speaking, divide themselves into two. In
one (<i>Little Iliad</i>, Ar. <i>Lysistr.</i> 155, Eur. <i>Andromache</i> 628) Menelaus
is about to kill her, but as she bares her bosom to the sword, the sword
falls from his hand. In the other (Stesichorus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<i>Sack of Ilion</i> (?))
Menelaus or some one else takes her to the ships to be stoned, and the
men cannot stone her. As Quintus of Smyrna says, "They looked on her as
they would on a God!"</p>

<p>Both versions have affected Euripides here. And his Helen has just the
magic of the Helen of legend. That touch of the supernatural which
belongs of right to the Child of Heaven&mdash;a mystery, a gentleness, a
strange absence of fear or wrath&mdash;is felt through all her words. One
forgets to think of her guilt or innocence; she is too wonderful a being
to judge, too precious to destroy. This supernatural element, being the
thing which, if true, separates Helen from other women, and in a way
redeems her, is for that reason exactly what Hecuba denies. The
controversy has a certain eternal quality about it: the hypothesis of
heavenly enchantment and the hypothesis of mere bad behaviour, neither
of them entirely convincing! But the very curses of those that hate her
make a kind of superhuman atmosphere about Helen in this play; she fills
the background like a great well-spring of pain.</p>

<p>This Menelaus, however, is rather different from the traditional
Menelaus. Besides being the husband of Helen, he is the typical
Conqueror, for whose sake the Greeks fought and to whom the central
prize of the war belongs. And we take him at the height of his triumph,
the very moment for which he made the war! Hence the peculiar bitterness
with which he is treated, his conquest turning to ashes in his mouth,
and his love a confused turmoil of hunger and hatred, contemptible and
yet terrible.</p>

<p>The exit of the scene would leave a modern audience quite in doubt as to
what happened, unless the action were much clearer than the words. But
all Athenians knew from the <i>Odyssey</i> that the pair were swiftly
reconciled, and lived happily together as King and Queen of Sparta.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>

<p>P. 54, l. 884, Thou deep base of the world.]&mdash;These lines, as a piece of
religious speculation were very famous in antiquity. And dramatically
they are most important. All through the play Hecuba is a woman of
remarkable intellectual power and of fearless thought. She does not
definitely deny the existence of the Olympian gods, like some characters
in Euripides, but she treats them as beings that have betrayed her, and
whose name she scarcely deigns to speak. It is the very godlessness of
Hecuba's fortitude that makes it so terrible and, properly regarded, so
noble. (Cf. p. 35 "Why call on things so weak?" and p. 74 "They know,
they know...") Such Gods were as a matter of fact the moral inferiors of
good men, and Euripides will never blind his eyes to their inferiority.
And as soon as people see that their god is bad, they tend to cease
believing in his existence at all. (Hecuba's answer to Helen is not
inconsistent with this, it is only less characteristic.)</p>

<p>Behind this Olympian system, however, there is a possibility of some
real Providence or impersonal Governance of the world, to which here,
for a moment, Hecuba makes a passionate approach. If there is <i>any</i>
explanation, <i>any</i> justice, even in the form of mere punishment of the
wicked, she will be content and give worship! But it seems that there is
not. Then at last there remains&mdash;what most but not all modern
freethinkers would probably have begun to doubt at the very
beginning&mdash;the world of the departed, the spirits of the dead, who are
true, and in their dim way love her still (p. 71 "Thy father far away
shall comfort thee," and the last scene of the play).</p>

<p>This last religion, faint and shattered by doubt as it is, represents a
return to the most primitive "Pelasgian" beliefs, a worship of the Dead
which existed long before the Olympian system, and has long outlived it.</p>

<p>P. 57, l. 922, The firebrand's image.]&mdash;Hecuba,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> just before Paris'
birth, dreamed that she gave birth to a fire-brand. The prophets
therefore advised that the babe should be killed; but Priam disobeyed
them.</p>

<p>P. 57, l. 924, Three Crowns of Life.]&mdash;On the Judgment of Paris see Miss
Harrison, <i>Prolegomena</i>, pp. 292 ff. Late writers degrade the story into
a beauty contest between three thoroughly personal goddesses&mdash;and a
contest complicated by bribery. But originally the Judgment is rather a
Choice between three possible lives, like the Choice of Heracles between
Work and Idleness. The elements of the choice vary in different
versions: but in general Hera is royalty; Athena is prowess in war or
personal merit; Aphrodite, of course, is love. And the goddesses are not
really to be distinguished from the gifts they bring. They are what they
give, and nothing more. Cf. the wonderful lyric <i>Androm.</i> 274 ff., where
they come to "a young man walking to and fro alone, in an empty hut in
the firelight."</p>

<p>There is an extraordinary effect in Helen herself <i>being</i> one of the
Crowns of Life&mdash;a fair equivalent for the throne of the world.</p>

<p>P. 57, l. 940 ff., Alexander... Paris.]&mdash;Two plays on words in the
Greek.</p>

<p>P. 58, l. 956, The old Gate-Warden.]&mdash;He and the Watchers are, of
course, safely dead. But on the general lines of the tradition it may
well be that Helen is speaking the truth. She loved both Menelaus and
Paris; and, according to some versions, hated D&ecirc;&iuml;phobus, the Trojan
prince who seized her after Paris' death. There is a reference to
D&ecirc;&iuml;phobus in the MSS. of the play here, but I follow Wilamowitz in
thinking it spurious.</p>

<p>Pp. 63 ff., Chorus.]&mdash;On the Trojan Zeus see above, on p. 11. Mount Ida
caught the rays of the rising sun in some special manner and distributed
them to the rest of the world; and in this gleam of heavenly fire the
God had his dwelling, which is now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> the brighter for the flames of his
City going up like incense!</p>

<p>Nothing definite is known of the Golden Images and the Moon-Feasts.</p>

<p>P. 64, l. 1088, Towers of the Giants.]&mdash;The prehistoric castles of
Tiryns and Myc&ecirc;nae.</p>

<p>P. 65, l. 1111, May Helen be there.]&mdash;(Cf. above.) Pitan&ecirc; was one of the
five divisions of Sparta. Athena had a "Bronzen House" on the acropolis
of Sparta. Simo&iuml;s, of course, the river of Troy.</p>

<p>P. 71, l. 1232, I make thee whole.]&mdash;Here as elsewhere Hecuba fluctuates
between fidelity to the oldest and most instinctive religion, and a
rejection of all Gods.</p>

<p>P. 72, l. 1240, Lo, I have seen the open hand of God.]&mdash;The text is,
perhaps, imperfect here; but Professor Wilamowitz agrees with me that
Hecuba has seen something like a vision. The meaning of this speech is
of the utmost importance. It expresses the inmost theme of the whole
play, a search for an answer to the injustice of suffering in the very
splendour and beauty of suffering. Of course it must be suffering of a
particular kind, or, what comes to the same thing, suffering borne in a
particular way; but in that case the answer seems to me to hold. One
does not really think the world evil because there are martyrs or heroes
in it. For them the elements of beauty which exist in any great trial of
the spirit become so great as to overpower the evil that created
them&mdash;to turn it from shame and misery into tragedy. Of course to most
sufferers, to children and animals and weak people, or those without
inspiration, the doctrine brings no help. It is a thing invented by a
poet for himself.</p>

<p>P. 75, l. 1288, Thou of the Ages.]&mdash;The Phrygian All-Father, identified
with Zeus, son of Kronos. (Cf. on p. 11.)</p>

<p>P. 76, l. 1304, Now hast thou found thy prayer.]&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>The Gods have deserted
her, but she has still the dead. (Cf. above, on p. 71.)</p>

<p>P. 79, l. 1332, Forth to the dark Greek ships.]&mdash;Curiously like another
magnificent ending of a great poem, that of the <i>Chanson de Roland</i>,
where Charlemagne is called forth on a fresh quest:</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
